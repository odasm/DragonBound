current version in progress :)

#### If you want to help me :)

Install the BD mysql and import the file .sql in back folder using a BD manager (example phpmyadmin, but it uses a port 8080 by default, conflicts with the port default by web.js in the project).

Configure the connection with BD in file mysql.js .

Configure the port connection in file web.js .

## Getting started
Install nodejs:
```sh

```
```sh
$ npm install
```
